// PR-BA-2: UTXO-set statistics primitives.
//
// Bitcoin Core port: `src/kernel/coinstats.{h,cpp}` (v28.0) -- ADAPTED.
//
// === IMPORTANT: hashChainCommitment is NOT BC's hash_serialized ===
//
// Bitcoin Core's `hash_serialized` is a STATE hash: it computes a canonical
// traversal-order hash over EVERY UTXO currently in the set, so two chains
// converging on the same UTXO set produce the SAME hash. Dilithion's
// `hashChainCommitment` is a CHAIN-PATH commitment, NOT a state hash:
// each block's stats are computed by folding `(parent_chain_commitment ||
// delta_record_for_this_block)` through SHA3-256. This means:
//
//   * Path-dependent: two chains that converge on the same final UTXO set
//     via different orderings produce DIFFERENT hashChainCommitment values.
//   * Intra-block-spend-leaky: a UTXO created and spent inside the same
//     block leaves residual contributions in the running hash even though
//     it never appears in the final UTXO set.
//   * Reorg-detection / chain-path integrity check ONLY: the value is
//     useful for confirming "the index is on the same chain history it was
//     on yesterday", not for "this UTXO set is the canonical one".
//
// What this implies:
//
//   * DO use hashChainCommitment for: persistent reorg detection at
//     restart, sanity-check against operator-supplied "expected hash at
//     height N" values produced by another node that took the SAME chain
//     ordering, BaseIndex monotonicity guards.
//   * DO NOT use hashChainCommitment for: cross-validation against
//     `gettxoutsetinfo` from a from-scratch UTXO walk, agreement with
//     BC's `hash_serialized`, or any context where a state-hash invariant
//     is required.
//
// TODO(PR-BA-3-design): PR-BA-3's `gettxoutsetinfo` fast-path needs a
// state-hash mechanism with a different invariant -- candidates are a
// canonical UTXO-set traversal performed at query time, or a different
// (PQ-secure) multiset accumulator. That is out of scope here.
//
// --- BLOCK-DELTA fold mechanics ----------------------------------------
//
// Bitcoin Core offers two algorithms for hashing the UTXO set:
//   - `hash_serialized` (deterministic order-dependent SHA-256 of all coins
//     in their canonical traversal order)
//   - `muhash` (commutative incremental hash; order-invariant)
//
// Dilithion ports NEITHER directly: it uses a SHA3-256 chain-path commitment.
// The hash is computed by the BLOCK-DELTA method: starting from the parent
// block's hash, we incrementally fold in the per-coin records added or
// removed by the block. The fold is implemented by feeding
// (parent_hash || delta_record) into SHA3-256 and taking the result as the
// new running hash.
//
// The order in which coins are folded matters for the final hash value, but
// is fully deterministic given the block's transactions and undo data:
//   - Spent inputs (from `CBlockUndo::vSpent`) are folded first, in the
//     writer's emit order (vin order across vtx, coinbase skipped).
//   - New outputs (from `CBlock` after deserialization) are folded second,
//     in (txid_lex_order, vout_index_ascending) order.
//
// SHA-3 substitution is the project-wide post-quantum hash convention.
//
// --- Concurrency --------------------------------------------------------
//
// `CoinStats` is a plain value type. The helper functions below mutate the
// passed-in struct in place and are thread-compatible (re-entrant on
// independent objects). The caller serialises access if the same object
// is shared across threads.
