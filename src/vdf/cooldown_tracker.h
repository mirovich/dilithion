/**
 * CCooldownTracker - VDF distribution rate limiter.
 *
 * After a miner wins a block, they enter a cooldown period during which
 * they cannot win again.  The cooldown length scales with the number of
 * active miners so that rotation is fair regardless of network size.
 *
 * Tracks by MIK identity (not payout address) to prevent address rotation
 * bypass.  Callers pass the 20-byte MIK identity extracted from the
 * coinbase scriptSig via ExtractCoinbaseMIKIdentity().
 *
 * Formula: cooldown = floor(activeMiners * 0.67)
 *   10 miners  →  6 blocks  (~33% eligible per round)
 *   22 miners  → 14 blocks  (~36% eligible per round)
 *   50 miners  → 33 blocks  (~34% eligible per round)
 *  100 miners  → 67 blocks  (~33% eligible per round)
 *
 * Dual-window (post-stabilization fork):
 *   effectiveCooldown = min(longCooldown, shortCooldown)
 *   Short window tracks recent participation; long window prevents gaming.
 *   Short window disabled at DilV genesis (vdfCooldownShortWindow=0).
 *
 * Time-based expiry (post-stabilization fork):
 *   Cooldown also expires when (currentTime - lastWinTime) >= cooldown × targetBlockTime.
 *   Handles chain stalls without needing a stall exemption.
 *
 * With MIN_COOLDOWN=2, a solo miner (n=1) gets cooldown=2 — they wait
 * ~95s between blocks (2 × 45s target via time-based expiry).  Chain
 * never stalls, just slows to ~95s/block during the solo phase.
 *
 * Thread-safe: all public methods acquire m_mutex.
